MOO SYSTEM DEFINITION:

Input: n (number of states)

STATE REPRESENTATION:
- magnitudes[0..n-1] ∈ {0,1,...,n}
- current_position ∈ {0,1,...,n-1} 
- moves_since_plus2 ∈ {0,1,2}
- total_moves (counter)
- injection_cycle (counter)

OPERATIONS PER MOVE:
1. CHOOSE OPERATION AT CURRENT POSITION:
   - Option 1 (+1): magnitude[pos] = min(n, magnitude[pos] + 1)
   - Option 2 (+2): if moves_since_plus2 ≥ 2:
        magnitude[pos] = min(n, magnitude[pos] + 2)
        APPLY TRIGGER:
           Find cell with MAX magnitude: decrease by 1
           Find cell with MIN magnitude: increase by 1
        moves_since_plus2 = 0

2. MOVE to adjacent position (bounded by ends)

PERIODIC EFFECTS (every move):
- FLIPS: when (total_moves % flip_period == 1)
   flip_period = 4→8→16→32 (progressive)
   magnitude[i] = n - magnitude[i] for all i
   
- INJECTIONS: when (total_moves % cycle_length == 0) 
   cycle_length = 131→100→80 (progressive)
   magnitude[i] = min(n, magnitude[i] + 1) for all i
   injection_cycle++

CONSTRAINTS:
- Valid Ordering: ∀i>0, if magnitude[i] > 0 then magnitude[i-1] ≥ magnitude[i] - 1

GOAL CONDITION:
- GOAL ≡ ∀i, magnitude[i] ≥ n

SEARCH METHOD:
- BFS with priority queue by total_moves
- Track best move count per unique state
- Convergence: stop after X states without improvement

GROWTH PROPERTIES:
L(1) = small
L(2) = 131
L(3) > 4728476+ (still growing)

KEY INSIGHT:
Finite state space but exponential path explosion creates astronomical move counts
through systematic exploration of all possible winding routes to goal.
